#Smart Contract Project - Event Organization
Blockchain, Solidity, and Ethereum

Blockchain
A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger shared among a computer network's nodes. They are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems
for maintaining a secure and decentralized record of transactions, but they are not limited to cryptocurrency uses.
Blockchains can be used to make data in any industry immutableâ€”the term used to describe the inability to be altered.



Solidity
 Solidity is a statically typed, contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.
 
 Background
  Solidity is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
  Smart contracts are programs that are executed inside a peer-to-peer network where nobody has special authority over the execution, and thus they
  allow anyone to implement tokens of value, ownership, voting, and other kinds of logic.

   When deploying contracts, you should use the latest released version of Solidity. This is because breaking changes, as well as new features and bug 
   fixes, are introduced regularly.


   

Ethereum
Ethereum is a decentralized open-source platform based on the blockchain domain, used to run smart contracts.


Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM) 
Ethereum Virtual Machine abbreviated as EVM is a runtime environment for executing smart contracts in ethereum. It focuses widely on providing security 
and execution of untrusted code using an international network of public nodes.
