#Smart Contract Project - Event Organization
Blockchain, Solidity, and Ethereum

Solidity
 Solidity is a statically typed, contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.

    Background
    Solidity is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Smart contracts are programs that are executed inside a peer-to-peer network where 
    nobody has special authority over the execution, and thus they allow anyone to implement tokens of value, ownership, voting, and other kinds of logic.

    When deploying contracts, you should use the latest released version of Solidity. This is because breaking changes, as well as new features and bug fixes, are introduced regularly.

Ethereum
Ethereum is a decentralized open-source platform based on the blockchain domain, used to run smart contracts.

Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM) 
Ethereum Virtual Machine abbreviated as EVM is a runtime environment for executing smart contracts in ethereum. It focuses widely on providing security and execution of untrusted code using an international network of public nodes.
